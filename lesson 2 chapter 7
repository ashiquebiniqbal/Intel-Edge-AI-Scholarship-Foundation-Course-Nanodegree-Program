kwChoosing Models
I chose the following models for the three tasks:
Human Pose Estimation: human-pose-estimation-0001
Text Detection: text-detection-0004
Determining Car Type & Color: vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039
Downloading Models
To navigate to the directory containing the Model Downloader:
cd /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/open_model_zoo/tools/downloader

Within there, you'll notice a downloader.py file, and can use the -h argument with it to see available arguments. For this exercise, --name for model name, and --precisions, used when only certain precisions are desired, are the important arguments. Note that running downloader.py without these will download all available pre-trained models, which will be multiple gigabytes. You can do this on your local machine, if desired, but the workspace will not allow you to store that much information.
Note: In the classroom workspace, you will not be able to write to the /opt/intel directory, so you should also use the -o argument to specify your output directory as /home/workspace (which will download into a created intel folder therein).
Downloading Human Pose Model
sudo ./downloader.py --name human-pose-estimation-0001 -o /home/workspace

Downloading Text Detection Model
sudo ./downloader.py --name text-detection-0004 --precisions FP16 -o /home/workspace

Downloading Car Metadata Model
sudo ./downloader.py --name vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039 --precisions INT8 -o /home/workspace

Verifying Downloads
-o /home/workspace directory 
From there, you can cd intel, and
then you should see three directories - 
cd name text-detection-0004
cd human-pose-estimation-0001
cd ehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039
Within those directories, there should be separate subdirectories for the precisions that were downloaded, 
check with ls command
and then .xml and .bin files within those subdirectories, that make up the model.
